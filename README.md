Export all your mail when you're in free plan / Exporter tout vos mail quand avec le plan gratuit / sans payer

## How to ?

- Go to your archive folder that you want to export from
- Open your web console
- Paste code in `exporter.js` in your console
- write on your console `protonExport()`.

done.

This will download all mail present in the page.
If you have a second page or more, then click on the second page and re-write `protonExport()` on your console.

Congrats, you hacked Protonmail, lol.
This scripts give freedom and privacy to people using a tool supposed to give freedom and privacy, great jobs protonmail team, you should at least make the export feature accessible to free plan.

Bye ;) 

/!\ At the end, check the size of exported email, 
If you get email of 256 bytes, it's mean you need to export it manually because the page took to long to load (due to heavy attachements)
